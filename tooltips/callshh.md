###### This is a number representing the number of 211 calls for every 100 households in a given area (i.e., a zip code). The purpose of this indicator is to standardize 211 calls across all zip codes in Austin, because some are more populated than others. By measuring calls for every 100 households, we understand if calls in that area are higher or lower than they are everywhere else in the city. In other words, if a zip code has 50 calls per 100 households and most other zip codes in the city have 10 or 12 calls per 100 households, we can reliably assume there is some measure of great need in that zip code and question what is driving such high call volumes in that particular zip code.
