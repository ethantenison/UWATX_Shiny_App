Whenever available, callers are given the opportunity to identify their age to the 2-1-1 Navigation Center. Any data that included a caller's identified age is recorded here. If callers elected not to identify their age or the call did not provide an opportunity to identify their age, it has been excluded for the purposes of better representing a visual analysis of known ages among callers.
