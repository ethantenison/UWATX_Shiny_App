The data on age were derived from answers to Question 4 in the 2017 American Community
Survey (ACS). The age classification is based on the age of the person in complete years at
the time of interview. Both age and date of birth are used in combination to calculate the
most accurate age at the time of the interview. Respondents are asked to give an age in
whole, completed years as of interview date as well as the month, day and year of birth.
People are not to round an age up if the person is close to having a birthday, and to estimate
an age if the exact age is not known. An additional instruction on babies also asks
respondents to print “0” for babies less than one year old. Inconsistently reported and
missing values are assigned or imputed based on the values of other variables for that person,
from other people in the household, or from people in other households (“hot deck”
                                                                         imputation).
Age is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper
questionnaire for households, both age and date of birth are asked for persons listed as person
numbers 1-5 on the form. Only age (in years) is initially asked for persons listed as 6-12 on
the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire. If a respondent indicates that there are more than
5 people living in the household, then telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain
date of birth data for the additional household members during the Failed Edit Follow-up
(FEFU) operation. In the Internet, Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI), and 
51
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, both age and date of birth is
asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This
included asking both age and date of birth for persons living in a group quarters. For
