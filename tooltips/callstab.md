### 6. The Calls Tab

After you've finished up with the Community Dashboard, click on "<i class="fa fa-phone-square"></i> The Calls" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Here you can explore tiered breakdowns of need by specific characteristics of caller data collected through the 2-1-1 Navigation Center. 

For example, in the opening visualization, you start by seeing what zip codes represented the greatest volume of call data. After clicking on a zipcode, you can then see which genders represented the great volume of call data in the selected zip code. Finally, when you can on that gender, you can see a detailed breakdown of need for that gender in that zipcode.
