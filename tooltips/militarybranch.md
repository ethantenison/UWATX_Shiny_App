When available, callers were provided with an opportunity to identify their affiliation with a military branch. When callers were explicity marked N/A and marked similarly for military status, callers were marked with "No Affiliation." When a caller's military branch classification was marked "Undetermined" or "Unknown", they were excluded from the analysis. The purpose of excluding "Undetermined" records is to better represent a visual analysis of known military branches.
