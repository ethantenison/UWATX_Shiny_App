The "Median Family Income" classification is taken from the ACS definition of "Income of Families ", which is described as the following:
  
  
In compiling statistics on family income, the incomes of all members
15 years old and over related to the householder are summed and treated as a single amount.
Although the family income statistics cover the past 12 months, the characteristics of
individuals and the composition of families refer to the time of interview. Thus, the income
of the family does not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the
family during all or part of the past 12 months if these individuals no longer resided with the
family at the time of interview. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did
not reside with the family during the past 12 months but who were members of the family at
the time of interview are included. However, the composition of most families was the same
during the past 12 months as at the time of interview.
