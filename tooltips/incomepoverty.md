Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates. 

#### Income To Poverty Ratios - 100%

Of those people whose poverty status has been determined, this represents the population of people living in or below poverty levels equal to the federal povery thresholds determined by the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. In other words, if the threshold was considered to be 12,

#### Income To Poverty Ratios - 200%

Dillon Ipsum Julie Taylor, will you marry me? Clear Eyes. Full Hearts. Saracen, quarterback's a captain. CHAMPIONS DON'T COMPLAIN! Why don't you take your Members Only jacket off and hang it on the coat rack? Blood, sweat and tears - it all stays right here on this field, right now! This is our dirt! This is our mud! This is ours, baby!

Using the census population variables for people whose poverty status was determined ("C17002_001E"), we can see understand that total population in mathematical form like this like this: 

$$ Tot_{PopulationSurveyed} = C17002\_001E$$

Then we take those variables of people living up to 200% of those poverty thresholds (seen below) and add them up, we get a figure we call "Poor or Struggling". In equation form, it can be understood like this:

$$ Tot_{PoorStruggling} = {C17002\_002E+C17002\_003E+C17002\_004E+C17002\_005E+C17002\_006E+C17002\_007E}$$

When we take the total number of people who are poor or struggling and divide by the total number of people surveyed (whose poverty status has been determined), then we can get our rate of the population who is poor or struggling. 

$$ Rate_{PoorStruggling} = 100 * (Tot_{PoorStruggling}/Tot_{PopulationSurveyed})$$
