###### When callers were willing to identify their gender, it was recorded in the 2-1-1 database. On occasion, callers opted to decline any identification of their gender. Other instances were marked "Unknown" or "Undetermined". Given the volume of those instances, which may have occurred because there was not an opportunity to ask this question of a caller, they were excluded from the visualization under "The Call Explorer". The purposes of this was to better represent a visual analysis of known genders among callers.
