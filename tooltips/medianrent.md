The "Median Rent" classification is taken from the ACS definition of "Median Gross Rent", which is described as the following:
  
Median gross rent divides the gross rent distribution into two equal
parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median gross rent and one-half above the
median. Median gross rent is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. (See the “Median Standard Distributions” section in Appendix A.) In computing median gross rent,units reported as “No rent paid” are excluded. Median gross rent is rounded to the nearest
whole dollar.
