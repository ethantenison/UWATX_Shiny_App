### 4. Explore The Community Profile & Need Profile Tabs

After you've selected a zip code, use the "Community Profile" & "Breakdown of 211 Calls by Need" tabs to explore detailed information about a zip code. From here, you can see changes across time for a given zip code by toggling the "Select A Year" slider or using the "<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i>" button to watch an animation of change over time starting from 2013 on through 2016.
